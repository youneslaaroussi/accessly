## Executive Summary

![](./media/accessly-overview.png)

Accessly transforms computer accessibility through voice-controlled AI automation, powered entirely by offline, private models. Built on Google's Gemma 3n architecture, this desktop application enables users with mobility limitations, visual impairments, or other accessibility needs to control their computers through natural conversation. The system combines wake word detection, speech recognition, intelligent task automation, and screen reading capabilities into a seamless, always-available interface that prioritizes user privacy and works without internet connectivity.

At its core, Accessly features an innovative **Screen Memory Vault** that automatically captures screen snapshots at configurable intervals, processes them through OCR, and stores vectorized embeddings locally using Gemma 3n's understanding capabilities. This creates a searchable, private archive of everything the user has seen or worked on, enabling powerful queries like "Find that document about accessibility I was reading last week" or "Show me the email thread with the client requirements." Critically, no network requests are ever made - all processing, storage, and retrieval happens entirely on the user's machine, ensuring complete privacy and offline functionality.

The application operates across both desktop environments and web browsers through an optional Chrome extension integration ([Accessly Plugin](https://github.com/youneslaaroussi/accessly-plugin)) that significantly amplifies its capabilities. While the core desktop functionality provides comprehensive OS-level automation, the browser plugin unlocks precise web interactions including DOM element extraction, CSS selector-based clicking, real-time audio capture from web pages, intelligent tab management, page reloading, and visual element highlighting for enhanced user feedback. This dual-layer approach ensures users can seamlessly transition between desktop applications and sophisticated web-based tasks using the same natural language interface.

Unlike traditional accessibility tools that require complex keyboard shortcuts or precise voice commands, Accessly understands natural language requests and can perform complex multi-step tasks autonomously. Users can compose emails, navigate websites, control applications, and search their interaction history simply by speaking to their computer after saying "Hey Gemma."

## Research-Backed Accessibility Impact

![](./media/impact_overview.png)

Accessly directly addresses documented accessibility barriers identified in peer-reviewed research. Studies consistently show that traditional accessibility tools create significant friction for users with disabilities:

**Performance Gaps in Traditional Tools:**
- Screen reader users take "between three and five times longer to complete" basic web tasks compared to sighted users (Craven, 2003) [1]
- Users "spend minutes traversing irrelevant elements before reaching desired information compared to vision users who visually skim in seconds" (Mohanbabu et al., 2025) [2]
- Traditional interfaces force users into "very linear" navigation where "everything for me with [the screen reader] is very linear" (Nielsen Norman Group, 2023) [3]

**User Frustration with Current Solutions:**
Research reveals deep dissatisfaction with existing accessibility technology. When asked to choose an app he loved because it was easy to use, one fully blind participant responded: "That's a hard statement because I don't love any app" - explaining that "all apps are challenging to use with a screen reader and take a long time to figure out" (Nielsen Norman Group, 2023) [3].

**Proven LLM Accessibility Benefits:**
Recent research demonstrates that AI-powered accessibility tools can dramatically reduce these gaps. Mohanbabu et al. (2025) showed that LLM-based systems reduced "the completion time gap between [vision users and screen reader users] from 2x to 1.2x" with 11 of 12 participants reporting the system "supported completing tasks with less effort and fewer distractions" [2].

**Accessly's Evidence-Based Solutions:**
- **Screen Memory Vault** addresses the documented lack of "visual memory for revisiting information" in traditional screen readers
- **Natural language commands** eliminate the need for "methodically swiping forward and backward to navigate" through sequential interfaces
- **Computer vision integration** solves the research-identified problem that "screen-reader users have little or no visual context for a link" (Nielsen Norman Group, 2023) [3]
